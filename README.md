 # 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis Project  
Exploratory data analysis of Netflix’s global catalog using Python, uncovering genre trends, regional preferences, and insights for content strategy.  

---

🔎 *Overview*  

This project analyzes a Netflix dataset (netflix.csv) to explore patterns in content production, distribution, and viewer preferences.  
The notebook (Netflix_Aug (3).ipynb) walks through *data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, and insight generation* — with an emphasis on thinking like a data-driven business strategist:  

- What do the data trends reveal about Netflix’s growth?  
- How can Netflix optimize its catalog for global and regional success?  

---

📂 *Dataset*  

- ~8,800+ titles (Movies + TV Shows)  
- Fields: Title, Director, Cast, Country, Date Added, Release Year, Rating, Duration, Genre, Type (Movie/TV Show)  

---

🛠️ *Tools & Libraries*  

- Python (Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook)  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

📈 *Key Insights*  

*1. Content Growth*  
- Content surged post-2015, peaking in *2020* (pandemic-driven additions).  
- Bulk uploads tend to happen at the *start of certain months (Jan, Jul, Oct, Nov)*.  

➡️ Netflix pursued a bulk-acquisition strategy to expand quickly.  

---

*2. Movies vs TV Shows*  
- *Movies = ~70%* of catalog (avg duration ~106 minutes).  
- *TV Shows = ~30%, avg **1.2–1.3 seasons* (dominated by limited series).  

➡️ Movies drive scale, but retention leans on TV shows — a gap vs competitors.  

---

*3. Regional Trends*  
- 🇺🇸 & 🇮🇳 lead in *movie production*.  
- 🇯🇵 & 🇰🇷 stand out in *TV shows* (anime + K-dramas).  

➡️ Growth levers differ regionally — “one-size-fits-all” doesn’t work.  

---

*4. Genre Patterns*  
- Dominant: Drama, International, Comedy.  
- Mid-tier: Action, Family, Independent.  
- Underrepresented: Classics, Sci-Fi, Kids.  

➡️ Catalog skews to mature content, leaving *family & kids* under-served.  

---

*5. Ratings*  
- *TV-MA (Mature): ~40%*  
- *TV-14: ~20%*  

➡️ Netflix’s sweet spot = young adults + mature audiences.  

---

🚀 *Business Recommendations*  

📍 *Global Strategy*  
- Expand *movies in US & India*; diversify into sci-fi, thrillers, family.  
- Double down on *anime & K-dramas* for global fandom & stickiness.  
- Strengthen *family/kids* content to capture households.  

📍 *Regional Growth*  
- *India:* Regional originals (Tamil/Telugu/Hindi) + mobile-first pricing.  
- *Korea:* Keep dramas, grow thrillers/sci-fi.  
- *Japan:* Position as “Home of Anime” + boost family-friendly anime.  
- *UK:* Prestige dramas + docuseries, leverage BBC/ITV partnerships.  

📍 *Content & Genre Strategy*  
- Add *200–300 K-dramas* yearly for global dominance.  
- Increase *kids/family* content from current ~10%.  
- Diversify into *underrepresented genres* (Sci-Fi, Classics, Fantasy).  

📍 *Platform Innovation*  
- *Interactive formats* (Bandersnatch-style shows).  
- *AI localization* → faster dubs/subtitles.  
- *Short-form episodes* for mobile-first markets.  

📍 *Competitive Positioning*  
- Against Disney+ → counter kids/family dominance with anime + fantasy.  
- Against Prime Video → bundle lifestyle (fitness, food, music).  
- Against local OTTs → exclusive deals with regional stars/studios.  

---

📊 *Visuals in Notebook*  
- Bar charts: Country distribution, genre counts, ratings.  
- Time-series: Titles added per year.  
- Distributions: Movie durations, TV show seasons.  

---

🏁 *Conclusion*  

Netflix’s catalog shows clear *strengths and gaps*:  

✅ Strong movie library, diverse genres, rising international content.  
❌ Weak in family/kids, limited long-running TV shows, heavy mature skew.  

*Strategic Playbook:*  
- *India:* Regional originals + mobile-friendly pricing.  
- *Japan:* Anime + kids.  
- *Korea:* Expand into thrillers.  
- *UK:* Docuseries + prestige dramas.  
- *Global:* Interactive + AI-powered localization.  

➡️ Netflix can become “globally available, locally unbeatable.”
